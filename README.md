# My-Portfolio

## Description

My portfolio includes a short bio, image placeholders for my future projects, and links to my social media accounts.

I implemented a navbar with links to different pages--'About', 'Portfolio', 'Contact'.

I changed the overall color scheme of the site to blue, my signature color. This is reflected in the navbar and the text on my 'About' page.

I added a sticky footer with a copyright image.

I added some placeholder images on my Portfolio page to signify where my future projects will appear.

## Credits

I used Bootstrap for the majority of this project, specifically for the navbar and sticky footer. I also used the grid system to create rows and columns on my pages.
